Set default page reading time, try to track users behaviour and measure +- in comparassion to control 'reader'. Try to play minor sounds at exact time when user is supposed to be on this word/sentence on the page. Keep looping with offset if uset stays on the page for too long to create and illusion of randomnes.

Allow user to have options to have trigger words in different colour and can trigger them manually while reading?

Try to read chapter/few pages in advance to build tension?
