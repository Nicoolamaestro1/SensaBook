Introduction
The raw material that we are working with is sound. Our purpose is to develop effective
ways to use sound to convey useful information. It is the relationships that we can construct
using sound that enable its articulation. The design space, therefore, is largely constrained
by the type and richness of of the sonic relationships employed.
The objective of this chapter, therefore, is to investigate the properties of sound that

Content: While these classes are not mutually exclusive, and can be used in combination, they
provide a useful vocabulary for our study. First, they help us categorize the work of others
for comparative purposes. Second, they help us in the process and rationalization of design.
Third, they help guide our study of raw materials. They help us know what to look for, and
to recognize properties of sound that can be exploited (or avoided).

Acoustics
Sounds are pressure variations that propagate in an elastic medium (for our purposes, the
air). Our ears are essentially very sensitive barometers that sense these pressure variations
and transforms them into a form which can be accommodated by the brain. There are a
number of useful ways to analyze these pressure variations. One is to represent them as
graphs of waves.

wave. Conversely, complex waves may be analyzed into their components via Fourier analysis.
When a wave is Fourier analyzed, the results may be shown in a spectral plot (Figures 3
to 6 show both spectral plots and waveforms). The spectrum of a wave is a two dimensional
representation showing the amplitudes of sine waves of different frequencies that comprise
the wave. Each spike on a spe

Content: Noise is made up of energy at many different frequencies. Figure 6 shows the flat
spectrum and rough waveform that characterizes white noise, which contains equal amounts
of all frequencies. Not all noise is white; for instance a noise might be band limited,
containing energy in a certain band of frequencies. Bandwidth refers to the range of
frequencies involved in a tone or noise.

Phase: its Implication on Sound and Representations
As a rule, frequency domain representations of sound can be more easily correlated to
perception than can time domain representations. For example, two sounds whose
waveforms look similar may sound quite different. On the other hand, two waveforms that
look quite different may sound similar, or the same (Plomp, 1976).
Figure 7 shows two waveforms which have the same spectra and sound identical.

most laws, in practical terms this one is better considered a guideline.
Simple Variation: Envelopes
Virtually all natural sounds change over time. Perhaps the most obvious dimension of
change is loudness, for how else could a sound have a start and a finish? Typically, this
change is not a simple switch on and then off. The loudness contour of most sounds is more
complex.

twice.
Spectral Variation over Time
We have already seen that most sounds are made up of spectral components, or partials, of
different frequencies. Typically, the relative amplitude of these partials does not remain
constant throughout the duration of a sound. That is, it is usually incorrect to think of the
envelope simply as a function

Helmholtz Revisited
The study of acoustics has been dominated for over a hundred years by the pioneering work
of Helmholtz (1885/1954). One of his main theories, and one which is still widely taught, is
that timbre can be explained solely in terms of spectra, independent of time. More recent
work has demonstrated that his theories are inadequate, and that the relative temporal change
among partials is an important determinant of the timbre of a sound. In fact, these relat

The darker the plot, the more energy.
Rather than show the amplitude envelopes of individual partials, a spectogram shows the
energy in (usually 1/3 octave) bands of the audible range. The darker the plot in each band,
the more the energy is there. This type of representation makes it very easy to get a sense of

instrument, formant frequencies are fixed, and do not vary with the frequency of the
vibration that is exciting the system. (See, for example, Slawson, 1968 for more on this.)
One consequence of this is that for a given instrument, the spectral properties of a note at
one pitch will typically be different than those at another (since being at different pitches,
different parts of the spectrum will fall within the resonant regions of the instrument).
Therefore, we cannot j

Content: Psychoacoustics
Up to now, we have been primailly discussing the physics or acoustics of sound. However,
our body does not take these stimuli from the physical world and just linearly map them into
the perceptual. The mapping between stimulus and percept is complicated by nonlinearities,
interactions, and bounded by the limitations of our sensory and cognitive capability.
In this section we look at these mappings and interactions, building upon the basic
understanding of acoustics developed in t

case, C's and D's. Because of the perceptual similarity of notes having the same chroma, despite large
differences in pitch height, pitch height alone should not be used in mapping data to pitch.

Each new note is a fifth above the previous one. If we use the ratio of 3:2 for a fifth, however, the note that we
get after 12 steps does not have an exact octave relationship with the start note.

Content: • Loudness is affected by bandwidth. Within a critical band, energy is summed; outside
of a critical band, loudness is summed. Sounds with a large bandwidth are louder than
those with a narrow bandwidth, even if they have the same energy.
• Loudness depends on duration. For sounds shorter than about a second, loudness
increases with duration. For example, for each halving in duration, the intensity of noise
bursts below 200 m.s. must be increased by about 3 dB in order to maintain constant

changes in the duration between two sounds is a change of about 10% for sounds longer
than 50 msec., and proportional to the square root of the duration for sounds of less than
50 msec. (Scharf & Buus, 1986, p. 14.62)

Two streams of sounds are shown, A and B. Each consists of a short sound followed by a second. The
first has a rectangular envelope (i.e., sharp onset and offset). The second has a slower gradual onset.
In A, the onsets of the sounds are equally spaced. Consequently, one would expect a regular rhythm to
be perceived if the pattern repeats. However, this is not true. Despite when the physical onset of the
second sound begins, the perc

Content: • However, this is not a very useful notion for at least two reasons. First, the spectrum of
virtually all sounds in nature is not static, so it makes little sense to talk about the
waveform of a violin, for example. Second, it has been shown that properties of
harmonics' dynamic behaviour can be far more important to timbre than the actual
harmonics themselves. (Add discussion of Risset.)

incomplete, to say the l

Remember, however, that there must be enough space to ensure that forward and backward
masking can't hide intended signals. There is a great deal of literature about masking; see in
particular Boff & Lincoln (1988).

"streams, which correspond to different sources of sound. Streaming takes place both in

Content: Changing Sounds
Changing sounds are the most noticeable and the most informative. Most simply, all sounds
involve changes of air pressure; if such changes are not large enough or fast enough, we
won't hear anything. But even if we can hear a sound, what we are most sensitive to are
changes, transitions, or transients. Sounds that don't change quickly fade into the perceptual
background.
• Change conveys information, and we tend to seek and attend to informative stimuli.

There are three aspects of sound localization that we want to understand in order to make
full use of available resources:
• the direction of the source, which is generally expressed in trms of its angular
displacement, or azmith, on the horizontal and median (vertical) planes;
• the distance to the source
• if the source is not stationary, its movement.

The Doppler Effect
The Doppler effect is an effect whereby the perceived pitch of a sound source changes due to
its relative motion towards or away from the listener. This is an effect that we hear every
day, such as when a car or train passes us: the pitch goes up as the sound source approaches,
and goes down as it moves away. It is an important effect to understand if one wants to be
able to simulate moving sound sources.
