ACOUSTICS AND
PSYCHOACOUSTICS
Introduction
The raw material that we are working with is sound. Our purpose is to develop effective
ways to use sound to convey useful information. It is the relationships that we can construct
using sound that enable its articulation. The design space, therefore, is largely constrained
by the type and richness of of the sonic relationships employed.
The objective of this chapter, therefore, is to investigate the properties of sound that
afford the construction of such relationships. The working assumption is that the better we
understand such properties, the more effectively we can use sound. It is sometimes said that
design is choice. If that is so, then the quality of design is affected by the richness of the
alternatives that one has to choose from and the criteria used in selection. Here we hope to
provide the acoustic and perceptual foundation to support both.
There are three classes of relationships that can be used to encode meaning into sound:
• intrasound relationships: These are relationships established among the parameters of
individual sounds themselves. For example, a message or datum may be encoded by
establishing a particular relationship among the pitch, timbre and duration of a sound.
• intersound relationships: These are relationships that are established between or among
sounds. It is through the pattern of sounds that meaning is conveyed. A simple example
would be assigning specific meaning to a particular motif.
• extrasound relationships: These are relationships that are established between sound and
entities that exist outside the domain of sound. For example, the sound of knocking on a
door tells us about someone wanting to enter, rather than something about sound.
