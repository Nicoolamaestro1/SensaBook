- **Phase Relationships**: Coordinate harmonic coherence for source identification

### **Intersound Relationships**
- **Pattern Recognition**: Establish motifs and recurring audio themes for story elements
- **Sequential Logic**: Create meaningful progressions through pitch relationships and intervals
- **Rhythmic Structures**: Use duration and timing to convey pacing and urgency
- **Spectral Fusion**: Group coherent variations to create unified sound sources

### **Extrasound Relationships**
- **Semantic Mapping**: Connect sounds to story events, characters, and environments
- **Emotional Encoding**: Translate detected emotions into appropriate sonic qualities
- **Contextual Cues**: Use cultural and genre-specific audio associations

        """Group sounds into perceptual streams"""
        pass
    
    def apply_masking_considerations(self, soundscape):
        """Ensure critical signals aren't masked"""
        pass
```

## Immersive Audio Design Principles (CEDIA Integration)

Based on the CEDIA/CTA-RP22 Immersive Audio Design recommended practice, our agent now incorporates professional-grade immersive audio design principles:

### **Core Immersive Audio Concepts**

#### **Performance Objectives**
- **Dialog Clarity**: Ensuring clear, intelligible speech reproduction
- **Localization Accuracy**: Precise sound positioning and spatial awareness
- **Sound Movement**: Smooth audio transitions and dynamic positioning
- **Sound Field Immersion**: Complete envelopment in the audio experience
- **Tonal Balance**: Consistent frequency response across all speakers
- **Dynamic Range**: Full spectrum from whisper-quiet to thunderous impact
- **Bass Impact**: Deep, controlled low-frequency reproduction
- **Audience Coverage**: Consistent experience across all seating positions

#### **Performance Levels (1-4)**
- **Level 1**: Basic immersive experience (5+ discrete speakers)
- **Level 2**: Enhanced immersion (11+ discrete speakers)
- **Level 3**: High spatial resolution (15+ discrete speakers)
- **Level 4**: Premium immersive experience (15+ discrete speakers with optimization)

### **Speaker Layout Design Methodology**

#### **Step-by-Step Design Process**
1. **Screen Speaker Placement**: Match viewing angles for sound-to-picture coherence
2. **Surround Speaker Definition**: Optimize based on listening area and room dimensions
3. **Front Wide Speakers**: Bridge screen and surround speakers for seamless transitions
4. **Upper Speaker Placement**: Position height/top speakers based on ceiling height and listening area

#### **Speaker Configuration Guidelines**
- **3 Screen Speakers**: For visual angles ≤40° or when surround speakers ≤8
- **5 Screen Speakers**: For visual angles ≥70° or when surround speakers ≥10
- **Surround Zones**: Side speakers avoid back wall, back speakers positioned behind listening area
- **Height Speakers**: 25°-40° elevation angles for optimal vertical immersion

### **Room Acoustics & Treatment**

#### **Acoustic Treatment Principles**
- **Front/Rear Walls**: Primarily absorbing materials in center portions
- **Side Walls**: Mixture of reflection, absorption, and scattering devices
- **Ceiling Treatment**: Scatter front speaker reflections toward room sides
- **Floor Materials**: Consider acoustic properties (carpet with open back for absorption)
- **Screen Acoustics**: Acoustically transparent materials for behind-screen speakers

#### **Treatment Placement Guidelines**
- **Diffusers**: Effective at lower-middle frequencies for immersion
- **Absorbers**: Sufficient thickness for broadband performance
- **Scattering Devices**: 300mm below to 1m above ear level on side walls
- **Phase Grating**: Minimum distances from listeners per manufacturer guidelines

### **Advanced Audio Optimization**

#### **Electronic Optimization (EQ)**
- **Traditional EQ**: Frequency domain adjustments for room modes and tonality
- **Time-Frequency Filters**: Phase and time domain optimization for speaker alignment
- **Bass Management**: Smooth room mode response below transition frequency
- **Phase Alignment**: Normalize time/phase differences between speakers

#### **EQ Best Practices**
- **Not a Remedy**: EQ fine-tunes well-designed systems, doesn't fix poor design
- **Filter Strategy**: Prefer reducing gain over increasing gain to preserve headroom
- **Measurement Tools**: Use acoustic measurement tools for precise optimization
- **Regular Comparison**: Compare equalized vs. non-equalized states during optimization

        # Optimize current system within constraints
        optimization_plan = self.optimize_current_system(
            current_performance_level, required_features
        )
        
        return {
            'optimal_level': optimal_level,

            'optimization_plan': optimization_plan,
            'performance_gap': optimal_level - current_performance_level
        }
