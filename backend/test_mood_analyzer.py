        turning all the rolling fields of Rohan to a golden haze. There was a beaten way, north-westward 
        along the foot-hills of the White Mountains, and this they followed, up and down in a green country, 
        crossing small swift streams by many fords. Far ahead and to their right the Misty Mountains loomed; 
        ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went by.""",

        in a single arch. The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the span, leaning 
        on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand Glamdring gleamed, cold and white. His enemy 
        halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, 
        and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm.""",

        of body, mind, and will, a match for both the loremasters and the athletes of the Eldar in the days 
        of their youth. Even among the Eldar she was accounted beautiful, and her hair was held a marvel 
        unmatched. It was golden like the hair of her father and of her foremother Indis, but richer and 
        more radiant, for its gold was touched by some memory of the starlike silver of her mother; and the 
        Eldar said that the light of the Two Trees, Laurelin and Telperion, had been snared in her tresses.""",

        betray him; for at once it took a new shape, and it fell upon his hand, and it was a ring of gold, 
        round and unadorned, the plain band of gold. But the writing upon it, which at first was as clear 
        as red flame, faded and was now only barely to be read. It was hot to the touch. Frodo felt a 
        sudden desire to put it on; and he had a feeling that if he did so, he would be able to see things 
        that were hidden from him.""",

        sound of water, and the sound of birds singing. But it was none of these, for it was the sound 
        of the Eagles, and it was the sound of the Eagles that was the most beautiful sound that had ever

1. TEXT PREPROCESSING:
   - Convert text to lowercase
   - Remove punctuation (optional)
   - Split into words or phrases

2. KEYWORD DETECTION:
   - Scan for mood category keywords (peaceful, tense, epic, etc.)
   - Count geographic elements (mountains, forest, water, etc.)
   - Identify weather conditions (storm, night, wind, etc.)
   - Measure emotional intensity indicators

3. MOOD CLASSIFICATION:
   - Score each mood category based on keyword frequency
   - Consider geographic and weather context
   - Determine primary and secondary moods
   - Adjust based on emotional intensity

4. SOUND SUGGESTION:
   - Match primary mood to available sounds
   - Consider geographic/weather context for specific sounds
   - Fall back to secondary mood or default

5. CONFIDENCE CALCULATION:
   - Based on number of detected elements
   - Higher confidence with more strong indicators
   - Boost confidence for clear mood signals
