# SensaBook Roadmap

Welcome to the SensaBook development roadmap! This guide outlines a step-by-step plan for building your immersive book reader, based on your current codebase and goals.

---

## 1. Vision & Foundation

### 1.1. Define "Immersive"
- Write clear user stories: What does an immersive reading experience mean for your users?
- Example: “As a user, I want ambient soundscapes that match the mood of each chapter.”

### 1.2. Documentation
- Update `README.md` with a project overview, setup instructions, and your vision.
- Use `docs/` for architecture diagrams, feature lists, and design notes.

---

## 2. Backend Development

### 2.1. Book Management
- Implement CRUD for books (add, update, delete).
- Support uploading book content and metadata (author, genre, cover image).

### 2.2. User Authentication & Profiles
- Add user registration, login, JWT authentication.
- Implement user profiles (reading history, preferences).

### 2.3. Emotion Analysis & Soundscape Generation
- Replace mock emotion detection with real NLP (e.g., spaCy, HuggingFace Transformers).
- Map book/chapter emotions to matching soundscapes.
- Store analysis results in the database for quick access.

### 2.4. API Expansion
- Add endpoints for:
  - Fetching soundscapes per book/chapter.
  - Managing user preferences.
  - Bookmarks and reading progress.
- Document APIs with OpenAPI/Swagger.

### 2.5. Testing & Quality
- Write unit/integration tests for all services.
- Set up CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) for automated testing.

## 3. Mobile Frontend (React Native)

### 3.1. Reader UI
- Design and build screens:
  - Home (book list, recommendations)
  - Reader (book text, audio controls, progress bar)
  - Settings (theme, audio, account)
  - Profile (history, favorites)

### 3.2. Sound Integration
- Implement audio playback synced to reading progress.
- Support background audio and user controls (volume, mute, etc.).

### 3.3. API Integration
- Connect to backend APIs (books, soundscapes, user data).
- Handle authentication and session management.

### 3.4. State Management
- Use context/hooks for theme, audio, user state.

### 3.5. Testing & UX Feedback
- Test on real devices and emulators.
- Gather feedback from test users, iterate UI/UX.

---

## 4. Advanced Features

### 4.1. AI/NLP Enhancements
- Explore advanced emotion/sentiment analysis.
- Consider voice narration using TTS (Text-to-Speech).

### 4.2. Personalization
- Recommend books based on user preferences and reading history.
- Adaptive soundscapes based on user mood or feedback.

---

## 5. Launch & Maintenance

### 5.1. Beta Release
- Prepare a beta version for a closed group of users.
- Collect feedback and bug reports.

### 5.2. Polish & Optimize
- Refactor code, optimize performance.
- Improve accessibility (fonts, color contrast, navigation).

### 5.3. Public Launch
- Write release notes and user onboarding guides.
- Set up support channels (GitHub Issues, email, Discord).

### 5.4. Continuous Improvement
- Monitor analytics and user feedback.
- Plan regular updates and new features.

---

## 6. Project Management Tips

- Use GitHub Issues/Projects to track tasks and milestones.
- Break down big features into smaller actionable issues.
- Review and update this roadmap regularly as the project evolves.
